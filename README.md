# Capstone Step 1 - Project Ideas

## 1. Trip Tracker
* Problem: Users may want to know when a flight may be available at a low price, but they're not checking the airline(s) frequently to see when the ticket is at the desired price.
* Solution: Create an app or website that collects data from major airlines and alerts the user when the price (specified by user and includes any price below that) the user is looking for is available. The airline websites are checked every hour, and the program would notify the user by email (if it’s a website) or with a pop-up notification (if it’s an app that will serve as a desktop widget).
  
## 2. Food Tracker/Weight Management App
* Problem: Individuals looking to lose weight lack a single, reliable source for an appropriate meal plan and accurate caloric intake. The abundance of conflicting and inconsistent information across different websites makes it difficult for people to determine an accurate weight loss plan.
* Solution: Create a website that accounts for the user’s age, weight, sex, etc. and give an accurate plan with some useful tips for the user to lose weight.
  
## 3. Info Map
* Problem: Users may need to view data concerning current global issues in a larger scope. That would require them to sift through multiple websites to gather their information.
* Solution: Data would be presented in the form of an info map. Users can view statistics for each country by hovering over the country of their choice. If the user may need more information about a certain issue in a country, the country selected will contain links to direct the user to different websites.
